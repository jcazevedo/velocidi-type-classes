# Type classes in Scala

This repository contains the material for a talk given at [Velocidi
Porto][velocidi] about type classes in Scala.

The presentation is a single [org mode][org-mode] file. It's meant to be used as
the layout of the presentation using [org-present-mode][org-present] directly
from Emacs.

The companion code is inside the `code/` folder as a standard Scala project.
