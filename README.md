# Type classes in Scala

This repository contains the materials for a talk given at [Velocidi
Porto][velocidi] about type classes in Scala.

The presentation is a single [org mode][org-mode] [file][presentation]. It's
meant to be used as the layout of the presentation using
[org-present-mode][org-present] directly from Emacs.

The companion code is inside the `code/` folder as a standard Scala project.
